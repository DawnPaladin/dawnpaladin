## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm James

I'm a designer and front-end web developer. I tackle complex topics and make them easy to understand.

Right now I'm [blogging](https://jamesharris.design/blog/) about how to make your personal infrastructure more resilient to the whims of fate and corporations. I'm also doing research about how to make personal websites faster and more secure by making the [Jamstack](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/glossary/jamstack/) accessible to non-coders. As a side project I'm working on a way to help people spend less time on Facebook's newsfeed by emailing them the stuff they care about.

I'm available for freelance work! [ðŸ“« Send me an email.](mailto:james.harris@hey.com)
